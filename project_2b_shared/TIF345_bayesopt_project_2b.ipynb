    "## Background\n",
    "In this project you will explore and search the potential energy surface (PES) for an Au atom placed on top of a Au surface.\n",
    "We will use a gold surface with Miller indices (433), which is so-called vicinal surface, corresponding to stepped (111) surface.\n",
    "The Au atom  placed ontop of the surface is refered to as an ad-atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/surface_433.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 850px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the left image shows a side view of the surface with the ad-atom colored in red.\n",
    "The right image shows the top view ($z$-direction) of the surface with the primitive cell marked as the smaller rectangle drawn in black.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the position of the ad-atom with the lowest energy is a difficult problem as there are multiple local minima in the PES.\n",
    "Furthermore, evaluating the potential energy is commonly done with density functional theory (DFT) which is very computationally expensive and hence it is desirable to keep the number of potential energy calculations as low as possible.\n",
    "To tackle these two problems we will employ Bayesian optimization using Gaussian Processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information on a very similar task can be found in the [paper by Todorovic *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-019-0175-2), a copy of which (`Todorovic-2019.pdf` is included in this directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Atomstic structure\n",
    "Here, instead of DFT, we will use an embedded medium theory calculator which is provided in [`ase`](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) or [`asap`](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/asap).\n",
    "You are given a atomistic surface in `structures/surface_supercell.xyz`, which can be read as\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from ase.io import read\n",
    "surface = read('structures/surface_supercell.xyz')\n",
    "```\n",
    "When searching for the optimal location of the ad-atom we only need to consider positions inside the primitive cell since the PES will be repeating itself if we move outside the primitive cell.\n",
    "We therefore only consider position in the domain\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "0 < x < 16.65653 \\quad  \\land \\quad 0 < y < 2.884996\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating the PES\n",
    "The ad-atom energy of interest, $E$, is defined as by\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E = E_\\text{ad} - E_\\text{surface},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $E_\\text{ad}$ is the potential energy of the system with the ad-atom present and $E_\\text{surface}$ the energy of just the bare surface system.\n",
    "When evaluating the PES, we consider the surface to be completly rigid and only allow the ad-atom to move.\n",
    "The energy can thus be written as \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E = E(x,y,z),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $(x,y,z)$ corresponds to the position of the ad-atom.\n",
    "Here, we will allow the $z$-coordinate of the ad-atom to relax to its local minima (given $x$ and $y$) and thus only consider the $x-y$ dependency of the energy, meaning we write the energy $E$ as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E(x, y) = \\min_z E(x, y, z).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to find the global minimum of the function $E(x, y)$ in as few evaluations of $E(x, y)$ as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "To this end, we turn to Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes (GPs).\n",
    "The idea is to iteratively train a GP to model the energy, $E(x, y)$, and use it to suggest new possible samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{X}$ be an array of shape $(N, 2)$ containing $(x, y)$ points as rows and $\\boldsymbol{E}$ an array of length $N$ with energies corresponding to $E(x,y)$ for each point in $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "First we construct an initial model from a few randomly drawn samples $\\mathbf{X}$ and their corresponding energies $\\boldsymbol{E}$.       \n",
    "This allows us to train a GP for the given $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\boldsymbol{E}$, which provides both an average value $\\mu$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma$ for the energy at $(x, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to select a new point $(x_\\text{new},y_\\text{new})$ for sampling.\n",
    "This is done by finding the point $(x_\\text{new},y_\\text{new})$ in the domain that maximizes the so-called acquisition function $A(x, y)$.\n",
    "In this project, we recommend using the lower confidence  bound (LCB) acquisition function, which is defined as \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "A(x, y) = -\\mu (x, y) + \\beta \\sigma (x,y).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Here, $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter that can be chosen approximately from the range 1 to 5.\n",
    "A large value of $\\beta$ will favor more exploration whereas a smaller value will lead to more exploitation.\n",
    "* **Exploitation:** Search regions with low mean (low energy)\n",
    "* **Exploration:** Search regions with high uncertainty/variance\n",
    "You can also adaptively adjust $\\beta$ during the Bayesian optimization.\n",
    "Can you think of suitable protocols?\n",
    "\n",
    "A new data point can thus be selected by\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(x_\\text{new}, y_\\text{new}) = \\arg \\max_{x, y} A(x, y)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Next the energy at this new point, $E(x_\\text{new}, y_\\text{new})$, is evaluated and added to our samples $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\boldsymbol{E}$.\n",
    "This allows a new GP model to be trained and we can iterate through this procedure until convergence is (hopefully) reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## GPy optimization\n",
    "Setting up your GP model can be achieved using a snippet such as the following\n",
    "```python\n",
    "k1 = GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=2)\n",
    "k2 = GPy.kern.Bias(input_dim=2)\n",
    "kernel = k1 + k2\n",
    "model = GPy.models.GPRegression(x_data, y_data, kernel)\n",
    "model.optimize()\n",
    "print(model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `model.optimize` will find the variance, length scale and bias that maximizes the log-likelihood for the GP.\n",
    "The log-likelihood may be very flat or contain multiple local minima.\n",
    "In case you end up with strange parameters (such as the lengthscale being $10^{-10}$ or $10^{10}$), it can help to rerun the optimization a few times which can automatically be done via\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "model.optimize_restarts()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Additionaly, it might help to put some reasonable constraints on the parameters, via\n",
    "```python\n",
    "k1 = GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=2)\n",
    "k1['lengthscale'].constrain_bounded(0.1, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead of strict constraints, one can also set priors over the parameters via, e.g.,\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "k1 = GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=2)\n",
    "k1['lengthscale'].set_prior(GPy.priors.Gamma(a=2, b=1))\n",
