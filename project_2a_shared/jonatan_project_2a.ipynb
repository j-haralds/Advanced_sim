    "# Project 2a: Alloy cluster expansions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will explore different methods for constructing an alloy cluster expansion model for the Au-Cu alloy, using various levels of physical intuition in the model construction process.\n",
    "This physical intuition will be instilled through more and more complex priors, ranging from the completely uninformative prior of OLS to a full Bayesian analysis where the prior hyperparameters are sampled as well.\n",
    "The different cluster expansion models are then applied to the problem of predicting the ground state structure amongst a few different candidates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is not required for you to understand all the details of the cluster expansion (CE) formalism to solve the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should hand in a report, via Canvas, maximum 6 pages (excluding references). \n",
    "Do not attach any appendices.\n",
    "In the report you should present your data, models and the final results.\n",
    "Do not forget to visualize your data and results.\n",
    "It is important that you discuss your findings and reflect on the results.\n",
    "In addition you need to hand in your Python code.\n",
    "Your code should run without errors and upon inspection reproduce the main results you present in the report.\n",
    "We will award extra points for code that we deem well written and structures (but we will not deduct points in the opposite case).\n",
    "Emphasis will be put on your ability to use appropriate terminology to describe and discuss the employed statistical methodologies and results.\n",

    "## Alloys\n",
    "In order to study alloys on the atomic scale one can resort to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.\n",
    "DFT can provide the energy of a given atomistic structure with high accuracy.\n",
    "The database that we provide you with is based on DFT calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixing energy per atom of a structure is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\large\n",
    "    E_\\text{mix} = \\frac{E_\\text{structure} - n_\\text{Au} E_\\text{Au} - n_\\text{Cu} E_\\text{Cu}}{n_\\text{Au} + n_\\text{Cu}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $E_\\text{structure}$ is the total energy of the structure, $n_\\text{Au}$ number of Au atoms in the structure and $E_\\text{Au}$ the energy of pure Au.\n",
    "Working with the mixing energy is often convient as it is the relevant energy when considering, e.g., phase stability of alloys.\n",
    "Below a few different structures (configurations) are displayed.\n",

    "## The configurational space problem\n",
    "If we consider a binary system (A-B) and a lattice consisting of 100 atoms, this yields $2^{100}\\approx 10^{30}$ unique ways of occupaying the lattice.\n",
    "While many of the structures will be duplicates when considering translation and rotational invariance we are still left with a huge number of configurations that would need to be considered for, e.g., thermodynamic averages or ground state searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the energy of multiple structures with DFT is computationally very expensive and thus to solve this configurational space problem one often turns to building atomistic models based on DFT.\n",
    "One of the more common atomistic models to employ is the alloy cluster expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cluster expansions\n",
    "The alloy cluster expansion is a model based on a perfect lattice.\n",
    "This lattice can be occupied by various chemical species (Au and Cu in our case).\n",
    "In this approach the energy of the atomic structure is modeled as a sum over the orbits times their corresponding effective cluster interaction.\n",
    "In principle it looks like\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\large\n",
    "E_{mix} = J_0 + \\sum_\\alpha m_\\alpha J_\\alpha,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ refers to different orbits such as nearest neighbor pairs, next nearest neighbor pairs, triplets etc, $m_\\alpha$ is the multiplicity, i.e. the number of symmetry equivalent clusters in the orbit per unit cell, and $J_\\alpha$ is the corresponding effective cluster interaction (ECI).\n",
    "In this project, we are not concerned with the details of decomposing a structure into orbits but simply use the [`icet` package](https://icet.materialsmodeling.org) for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/clusters_v1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we focus on how to determine the unknown parameters (ECIs) for the cluster expansion model, and how to choose which type of clusters (orbits) to include in the model.\n",
    "The equation above can be formulated as a dot product by defining $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}=[1, N_1, N_2, ...]$ and $\\boldsymbol{J}=[J_0, J_1, J_2, ...]$ as $E_{mix} = \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\boldsymbol{J}$.\n",
    "Here, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is often refered to the cluster vector of the given configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mixing energy, $E_{mix}$, is provided, e.g., from DFT calculations, for a set of configurations, then the problem of finding the ECIs, $\\boldsymbol{J}$, can be cast in the form of OLS\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\large\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{J}_{opt} = \\min \\boldsymbol{J} || \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J} - \\boldsymbol{E_{mix}} ||_2 ^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{E}_{mix}$ is a vector containing the mixing energies for all structures and $\\boldsymbol{X}$ a matrix where each row corresponds to a cluster vector one of the given structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The linear problem\n",
    "Simplest way to solve the linear problem would be to use ordinary least-squares (OLS). However, OLS tends to overfit and thus linear regression with regularization such as Ridge and LASSO are feasible alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue in finding the ECIs is to select an approriate number of features (clusters) to include in the model. Features in our problem would corresponds to clusters with various interatomic distances and order. Too few can lead to underfitting and too many to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will construct cluster-expansion model using linear regression methods such as Lasso and ARDR. You will use cross-validation but also information criteria such as AIC and BIC in order to evaluate how many features is reasonable to include in your cluster expansion. For more information and details about these methods and metrics, see the lecture notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you will see how bayesian parameter estimation of the ECIs can be used for cluster-expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross validation\n",
    "You may freely chose a suitable cross-valdation method to use for the following tasks. K-fold is commonly used and available through `sklearn` (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html). Ten folds might be a good starting point to try out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information criteria\n",
    "The Bayesian information criteria (BIC) is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{BIC} = 2 log(L_*) - N_p log(N_d)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $L_*$ is the maximized likelihood, $N_p$ the number of parameters, and $N_d$ number of data points.     \n",
    "The energies (or data) can be modeled through\n",
    "Here we assume the errors, $\\epsilon$, are normal distributed with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{E} = \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\boldsymbol{J} + \\epsilon , \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu=0, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Therefore the likelihood, $P(D|\\boldsymbol{J}, \\sigma)$, can be defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L = P(D|\\boldsymbol{J}, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{N_d/2}}\\exp{(-||\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J}-\\boldsymbol{E} ||^2 / 2\\sigma^2)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The ECIs, $\\boldsymbol{J}$, you will obtain from linear regression algorithms (LASSO, etc), and $\\sigma$ can be found from setting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} L }{\\mathrm{d} \\sigma} = 0$. This is left as an exercise to the reader but final expression for BIC becomes\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{BIC} = -N_d log(\\text{MSE}) - N_p log(N_d) + \\text{const}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the constant term, $\\text{const}$, is irrelevant and $\\text{MSE}$ is the mean squared error, defined as \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{N_d}||\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J}-\\boldsymbol{E} ||^2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### sklearn\n",
    "Regression algorithms like OLS, Ridge, ARDR (and many more) are available in `sklearn`. One can also use the [`StandardScaler`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) from `sklearn` to standardize data. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Since we're including the constant term in our cluster vectors we need to set `fit_intercept=False` when using the linear models from sklearn.*"

    "Ridge regression regularizes parameters by using the $\\alpha$ to penalize larger absolute values of the ECIs. This is a very general approach that works for a broad range of problems, and can be motivated by physical intuition in that smaller parameter values are favored. However, we can improve upon Ridge regression by creating more elaborate regularization schemes that inlcude physical intuition about our specific system. \n",

    "One example of such physical intuition is that we expect cluster orbits with more sites and with a larger distance between them to contribute less to the overall energy of the structure than smaller/more compact clusters. In other words, we expect that the ECIs decrease with the number of sites and the size of a orbit. Following the approach outlined Mueller et al. in [Physical Review B **80**, 024103 (2009)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.024103), this can be achieved by modifying the Ridge least-squares estimator as follows: \n",
