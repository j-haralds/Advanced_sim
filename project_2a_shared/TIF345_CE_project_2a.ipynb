    "This physical intuition will be instilled through more and more complex priors, ranging from the completely uninformative prior of OLS to a full Bayesian analysis where the prior hyperparameters are sampled as well.\n",
    "The different cluster expansion models are then applied to the problem of predicting the ground state structure amongst a few different candidates. \n",

    "In order to study alloys on the atomic scale one can resort to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.\n",
    "DFT can provide the energy of a given atomistic structure with high accuracy.\n",
    "The database that we provide you with is based on DFT calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixing energy per atom of a structure is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\large\n",
    "    E_\\text{mix} = \\frac{E_\\text{structure} - n_\\text{Au} E_\\text{Au} - n_\\text{Cu} E_\\text{Cu}}{n_\\text{Au} + n_\\text{Cu}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $E_\\text{structure}$ is the total energy of the structure, $n_\\text{Au}$ number of Au atoms in the structure and $E_\\text{Au}$ the energy of pure Au.\n",

    "## The configurational space problem\n",
    "If we consider a binary system (A-B) and a lattice consisting of 100 atoms, this yields $2^{100}\\approx 10^{30}$ unique ways of occupaying the lattice.\n",
    "While many of the structures will be duplicates when considering translation and rotational invariance we are still left with a huge number of configurations that would need to be considered for, e.g., thermodynamic averages or ground state searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the energy of multiple structures with DFT is computationally very expensive and thus to solve this configurational space problem one often turns to building atomistic models based on DFT.\n",
    "One of the more common atomistic models to employ is the alloy cluster expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cluster expansions\n",
    "The alloy cluster expansion is a model based on a perfect lattice.\n",
    "This lattice can be occupied by various chemical species (Au and Cu in our case).\n",
    "In this approach the energy of the atomic structure is modeled as a sum over the orbits times their corresponding effective cluster interaction.\n",
    "In principle it looks like\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\large\n",
    "E_{mix} = J_0 + \\sum_\\alpha m_\\alpha J_\\alpha,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ refers to different orbits such as nearest neighbor pairs, next nearest neighbor pairs, triplets etc, $m_\\alpha$ is the multiplicity, i.e. the number of symmetry equivalent clusters in the orbit per unit cell, and $J_\\alpha$ is the corresponding effective cluster interaction (ECI).\n",
    "In this project, we are not concerned with the details of decomposing a structure into orbits but simply use the [`icet` package](https://icet.materialsmodeling.org) for this purpose.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/clusters_v1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we focus on how to determine the unknown parameters (ECIs) for the cluster expansion model, and how to choose which type of clusters (orbits) to include in the model.\n",
    "The equation above can be formulated as a dot product by defining $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}=[1, N_1, N_2, ...]$ and $\\boldsymbol{J}=[J_0, J_1, J_2, ...]$ as $E_{mix} = \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\boldsymbol{J}$.\n",
    "Here, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is often refered to the cluster vector of the given configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mixing energy, $E_{mix}$, is provided, e.g., from DFT calculations, for a set of configurations, then the problem of finding the ECIs, $\\boldsymbol{J}$, can be cast in the form of OLS\n",

    "\\large\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{J}_{opt} = \\min \\boldsymbol{J} || \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J} - \\boldsymbol{E_{mix}} ||_2 ^2,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{E}_{mix}$ is a vector containing the mixing energies for all structures and $\\boldsymbol{X}$ a matrix where each row corresponds to a cluster vector one of the given structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The linear problem\n",
    "Simplest way to solve the linear problem would be to use ordinary least-squares (OLS). However, OLS tends to overfit and thus linear regression with regularization such as Ridge and LASSO are feasible alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue in finding the ECIs is to select an approriate number of features (clusters) to include in the model. Features in our problem would corresponds to clusters with various interatomic distances and order. Too few can lead to underfitting and too many to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will construct cluster-expansion model using linear regression methods such as Lasso and ARDR. You will use cross-validation but also information criteria such as AIC and BIC in order to evaluate how many features is reasonable to include in your cluster expansion. For more information and details about these methods and metrics, see the lecture notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you will see how bayesian parameter estimation of the ECIs can be used for cluster-expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross validation\n",
    "You may freely chose a suitable cross-valdation method to use for the following tasks. K-fold is commonly used and available through `sklearn` (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html). Ten folds might be a good starting point to try out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information criteria\n",
    "The Bayesian information criteria (BIC) is defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{BIC} = 2 log(L_*) - N_p log(N_d)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $L_*$ is the maximized likelihood, $N_p$ the number of parameters, and $N_d$ number of data points.     \n",
    "The energies (or data) can be modeled through\n",
    "Here we assume the errors, $\\epsilon$, are normal distributed with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{E} = \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\boldsymbol{J} + \\epsilon , \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu=0, \\sigma^2) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Therefore the likelihood, $P(D|\\boldsymbol{J}, \\sigma)$, can be defined as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "L = P(D|\\boldsymbol{J}, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{N_d/2}}\\exp{(-||\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{J}-\\boldsymbol{E} ||^2 / 2\\sigma^2)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The ECIs, $\\boldsymbol{J}$, you will obtain from linear regression algorithms (LASSO, etc), and $\\sigma$ can be found from setting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} L }{\\mathrm{d} \\sigma} = 0$. This is left as an exercise to the reader but final expression for BIC becomes\n",

This is a very general approach that works for a broad range of problems, and can be motivated by physical intuition in that smaller parameter values are favored.

Following the approach outlined Mueller et al. in [Physical Review B **80**, 024103 (2009)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.024103), this can be achieved by modifying the Ridge least-squares estimator as follows: \n",

    "In this final task, you will compare all the earlier techniques (Tasks 2-5) in predicting the ground state of candidate clusters.The ground-state structure refers to the structure with the lowest energy for a given concentration. Macroscopic properties like thermal conductivity, heat-capacity etc can depend strongly on the particular ground-state configuration and it is therefore important to know the correct ground-state structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the database `ground_states_candidates.db` you will find potential ground-state candidates. In this task you will assign each ground-state candidate in the database an estimated energy, and use your results from task 4 to estimate the probability of each candidate being the actual ground-state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    "* Use the models that you've studied in Tasks 2-5 to predict the ground state structure and energy.\n",
    "    * From Task 2, use OLS and the RIDGE model with optimal hyperparameter that you found. \n",
    "    * From Task 3, use the optimal Covariance model that you found.\n",
    "    * From Task 4, use the cluster-expansions samples (from MCMC) and compute the frequency of each candidate structure being the ground-state.\n",
    "        * Also plot the disitrubtion of the ground-state energy.\n",
    "    * From Task 5, use the ARDR model with the optimal hyperparameter that you found.\n",
    "* Compare the results from predicting the ground state with Task 2-5 and discuss the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Discuss:**\n",
    "* Can you spot any differences between the models in predicting the ground state? Why/why not?\n",
    "* Which model approach do you think is the most suitable for this problem? (No right or wrong answer here; it's the discussion that's important)\n",
    "    * In particular elaborate on the differences between automatic feature selection (such as Ridge/ARDR) and more hands-on, physical intuition based approaches (such as Covariance/Full Bayesian).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hints*\n",
    "* Remember that the ECIs have previously been normalized. You will thus have to normalize the ground state candidate cluster vectors and transform the predicted energies back to the original energy scale. "
